## Description

Pendulum is a Python simulation project that allows users to interact with a pendulum through a graphical interface. The simulation is based on the second-order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the pendulum's motion.

## Usage

To use Pendulum, you need to run the main.py file. The simulation starts by manipulating the pendulum with the mouse. Follow the on-screen instructions to adjust parameters and view graphical representations of the pendulum's behavior.

## Commands

- **P**: Pauses/resumes the simulation.
- **R**: Toggles redimension mode, allowing you to adjust the pendulum's parameters.

## Menu Items

- **Length (m)**: Sets the length of the pendulum.
- **Mass (kg)**: Sets the mass of the pendulum's weight.
- **Gravitational acceleration (m/sÂ²)**: Sets the gravitational acceleration.
- **Drag factor**: Sets the resistive force acting on the pendulum.
- **Graph**: Selects the type of graph to display (Energies, Angle, Positions).
- **Timespan**: Adjusts the time interval for graph display.
- **Export graph**: Initiates the export of the selected graph.
- **Exit**: Exits the application.
